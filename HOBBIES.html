                  Royal Enfield Interceptor 350 Spied on test for the first time, the Royal Enfield Interceptor 350 is expected to bring in as much acclaim to the bike-maker as has been seen in the case of the Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650. The Interceptor 350 will borrow design elements from its larger counterpart with similar looking tail lamp assembly and rectangular shaped turn indicators. Royal Enfield Meteor 350 engine has been tested across India, Spain and the UK. Royal Enfield Interceptor 350 will borrow several styling features identical to the Interceptor 650. Likely to be based on the same platform as the 650cc RE, spy pics of the new cruiser also detailed foot pegs, rear fender and rear suspension borrowed from the Interceptor 650. However, the bike could get the same inverted forks and twin shock absorbers at the rear along with a twin pod digital instrument cluster as seen on the Meteor 350. It could also borrow the Tipper Navigation System,</p> </td>
